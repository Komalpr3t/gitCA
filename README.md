## Git Commit States

Git tracks files through different states in the repository:

### 📝 Untracked  
- Newly created files that are not yet tracked by Git.  
- They do not appear in the staging area.  

### 📌 Staged  
- Files that have been added to the **staging area** and are ready to be committed.  
- These changes will be included in the next commit.  

### ✅ Committed  
- Files that have been permanently saved in the local repository.  
- They are stored in Git’s history with a unique commit ID.
